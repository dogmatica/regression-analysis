As governments worldwide give greater attention to environmentally friendly legislation, 
the focus on reducing CO2 emissions has been increasing. In the United States, regulations are 
already in place at the federal level limiting CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. It is estimated 
that "30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from industry, including indirect 
emissions from the sector’s electricity consumption" (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, 
2021). The industrial sector will be a logical area of focus for reduction of greenhouse gasses in 
the coming years. My research project utilized one year's worth of energy consumption and 
tCO2 (total carbon dioxide) data taken from the DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd in Gwangyang, South 
Korea, provided courtesy of the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua and Graff, 2021). I 
hypothesized that a statistically significant relationship exists between energy consumption kWh 
and tCO2, which I would consider proven via p-value ≤ 0.05 and r-squared > .90.
